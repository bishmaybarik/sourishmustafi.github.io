# About

Hello! I am currently pursuing a master's degree in economics at [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/home/), with a focus on research. My primary interest lies in macroeconomics and economic growth, and I aspire to further my academic journey by pursuing a PhD. I am learning and growing my skills in [Stata](https://www.stata.com) and [MATLAB](https://in.mathworks.com/company.html), frequently working with data and coding. My goal is to contribute to academia and achieve publications in the field. When I am not engaged in academic pursuits, I enjoy clicking pictures, exploring my surroundings, and contemplating the next big economic breakthrough.
