#  1. Does Overconfidence Lead to Procrastination?: A Cognitive Reflection Test Experiment
**Supervisor:** [Dr. Punarjit Roychowdhury](https://punarjitroyc.weebly.com) (2024, Shiv Nadar University)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b style="color: #000000;">Abstract:</b> Overconfidence and Procrastination, are two vast and distinct areas in the field of Behavioural Economics. This study tries to construct a bridge between both these areas and understand whether an overconfident individual is more likely, less likely or does it have no effect on procrastination of a particular task. Over-confidence among the students has been captured through the Cognitive Reflection Test and self-evaluation methods, followed by observing the identified over-confident students’ behaviour on delaying tasks, hence capturing procrastination among them.

# 2. An Environmental Kuznet’s Curve Analysis for River Economies: A Case Study on Ganga and Yamuna
**Supervisor:** [Dr. Ram Ranjan](https://snu.edu.in/faculty/ram-ranjan/) | **Co-author:** Manya Pahwa (2024, Shiv Nadar University)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b style="color: #000000;">Abstract:</b> The Environmental Kuznets Curve suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between the level of pollutants in the environment and the level of income. This study, by employing a panel data set for a total of 8 states, through which Ganga and Yamuna flow, tries to establish EKC relationships for Fecal Coliform, Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand, Nitrates and Nitrites and Conductivity. The data has been collected over the period 2012-2020 (except for the year 2015). This exercise is done separately for each River Economy. The concerned states are Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Clear, inverted U-shaped curves are estimated for all pollutants for Ganga, but for Yamuna, U-shaped curves are observed in most cases except for fecal coliform. The results for Nitrate-Nitrite and Conductivity have been obtained with relative robustness. However, unlike other studies, the results obtained for fecal coliform and biochemical oxygen demand are not robust in this paper.

## Undergraduate Dissertation (B.Sc. Economics (Hons.), XIM University)
# **3. Title:** Economics of Discrimination: Review of Gary Becker’s work and its application on India
**Supervisors:** [Dr. Bharatee Bhusana Dash](https://sites.google.com/view/bharateebhusanadasheconomics/home) & [Dr. Pintu Parui](https://www.economics.iitb.ac.in/pintu.html)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b style="color: #000000;">Abstract:</b> Discrimination is a problem that has been existing for many centuries, and it is essential to understand the economics behind this practice. This dissertation discusses how economists understand discrimination and explains why discrimination persists today. It also has covered crucial aspects of taste-based discrimination, which talks about people who discriminate because of ‘ignorance’ and ‘prejudice,’ and statistical discrimination practiced by firms whose motive is profit maximization. From the ethical point of view of society, taste-based discrimination is considered unfair, whereas statistical discrimination is fair. My study covers the model proposed by Gary Becker (1957), which focused on taste-based discrimination and applied it in the United States in the context of racial discrimination. Caste discrimination in India aligns with taste-based discrimination, where over the years, India has seen the emergence of various deprived castes. The reason behind this is prejudice and ignorance, which has ultimately led to discriminatory attitudes of the upper castes against the oppressed social groups. This dissertation reviews and applies Becker’s (1957) work on the economic model of discrimination in India and constructs an extension to the model where certain assumptions have been relaxed. In the Indian context, the model has been applied to two social classes, the higher and the lower class, where they are assumed to be perfect substitutes, and this distinction is made based on the respective group’s economic position in society. The model also explains why it would be inefficient for the employer to practice discrimination in the firm by highlighting the monetary costs of discrimination. Finally, the dissertation also consists of a chapter that captures the ideas of affirmative action in India and the rationale behind implementing them. The chapter also suggests policy prescriptions that could help erase people’s discriminatory mindsets in the long run.

# 4. Gains from Trade: An Intuition behind Why Countries Exchange
**Supervisor:** [Dr. Anwesha Bandyopadhyay]([https://snu.edu.in/faculty/ram-ranjan/](https://sites.google.com/view/anweshabandyopadhyay/home)) | **Co-author:** Sharanya Roy (2022, XIM University)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b style="color: #000000;">Abstract:</b> Will countries still trade if they produce goods with the same characteristics? The primary objective of this article is to understand the concept of gains from trade, at a micro level and take it to a macro level.We have compiled various examples and ap- proached this topic by initially understanding the essence of the Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics and finding its deep lying intuition using the Robinson Crusoe Model and the famous Ricardian Model. The aim is to understand whether it will be beneficial for countries to trade under such circumstances or if it is just a myth that trading is advantageous to countries
